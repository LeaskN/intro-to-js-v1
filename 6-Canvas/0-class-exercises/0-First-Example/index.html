            The canvas element can only use two attributes, width & height. If not specified, the default
            will initially be 300px wide & 150px high.

            You can also set width and height and other styles with CSS of course. There are some gotchas to watch out for.
            Use the documentation when things don't quite work out (like if your rendering seems distored).

            Just by convention we give our canvas an id. It also needs to have a closing </canvas> tag.

            We should provide Fallback content for our canvas element for browsers that do not support the element.
            Just insert the fallback content inside the element itself.
        -->
        <canvas id="canvas"> This is my fallback content. Your browser is irrelevant. </canvas>
        <script src="js/script.js"></script>
