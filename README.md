# Nebula-v5
The Nebula V5 curriculum repository.

## The formula 

- From week to week there will be modules for the students
- They'll be responsible for reading through the content (README.md) 
- In class there will be review - instructors will have additional guided notes to aid them (comments / js files to fill out). 
- Students will complete assignments to demonstrate understanding
- Students will complete checkpoints to assess understanding
- If scoring below a 94% a student will be required to attend office hours. The number office hours is dependent upon the score achieved. 

Exercises:
- There will be frequent stops throughout the instruction where the students will be coding themselves -> exercises based on the most recent content reviewed.

## Using the browser console and VS code's terminal
- Introduce them to writing code in the console ASAP. This allows for students to quickly test JavaScript code seamlessly and easily.
- Consider introducing the debugging tool in VS code in order for students to "step through" their code.

## Global Searching The Repository
- Introduce the idea of using VS code to do a global search on topics / vocabulary throughout the course to find examples / explanations. Remind students not to rely strictly on the repository and that doing their own online research matters. A lot of things aren't covered in the class repository or might be explained better else where.
