    You should be able to:
        1- Define the DOM & it's role
        2- Talk about HTML elements as being parents, children, and siblings
        3- Use common DOM manipulation patterns, including:
            - Querying for an element.
            - Editing an element.
            - Ading an element.
            - Removing an element.
            - Use DOM commands to interact with a page.
        
    What is the DOM?
        It stands for the Document Object Model. It's known as a programming interface for HTML and XML documents:
        It represents the collection of HTML elements from a webpage as nodes and objects. This allows for 
        programming languages, like JavaScript, to connect to the page.

        A Web page is a document, so index.html is the classic document name you'll see. When you open that document
        in the browser, the HTML elements are rendered into nodes & objects.

    How can we look at the DOM?
        After your HTML page is loaded into the browser, use your Developer Tools (right click inspect) to check it out! You'll see
        it in the same structure as your HTML.

    If you're wondering what what a node is:
        "A node is the generic name for any type of object in the DOM hierarchy. 
        A node could be one of the built-in DOM elements such as document or document.body, 
        it could be an HTML tag specified in the HTML such as <input> or <p> or it could be a 
        text node that is created by the system to hold a block of text inside another element.
        So, in a nutshell, a node is any DOM object." - Taken from the second resource below

    Querying the DOM:
        Searching through the document in order to find an element.
        
        How can we do this?
            Use this function (method): .querySelector()

        Remember we can "traverse" the DOM, find an element, and store a reference
        to that element in a variable.
            const holdH1 = document.querySelector('h1');
        
        We can also use CSS syntax to target certain elements in our HTML:
            const holdIdElement = document.querySelector("#some-id");
                - Notice how we are using a CSS selector in our querySelector function.
                - Notice how that CSS selector needs to be passed in as a string.
                - We can use any CSS selectors in here, as long as we are targetting ONE element.
        
        How can we target multiple elements?
            Use this function (method): Element.querySelectorAll()

        Lets see it in action:
            const holdAllDivs = document.querySelectorAll('div');
                - This is going to store an array of all our div tags on the document.
        
        We can also use:
            - Element.getElementById('someId')
            - We don't have to use a '#' within the parentheses

        We can also use:
            - Element.getElementsByClassname("className")
            - Like .querySelectorAll(".className") -> except we can omit the period

        We can also use:
            - Element.getElementsByName("name")
            - This returns a list of elements that have the specified HTML attribute.
    
    Element Creation:
            - Document.createElement("elementName");
            - Used with the name of the element you are trying to create.
    
    DOM Editing:
            (not Node.js the runtime envrionment we've been using)
            (node is a generic name for an object - ie an Element is a type of node)
            (NOTE: there are certain methods / properties that only exist on the "Node" and "Element" interface...)
            - Node.appendChild();
            - Node.removeChild();
            - Node.innerText
            - Node.setAttribute();
            - Node.id
            - Node.classList
            ... and more

    DOM Traversal:
            - Node.childNodes
            - Node.children
            - Node.firstChild
            ... and more

    What about changing CSS with JavaScript?
        An example:

            const holdDiv = document.querySelector("div");

            holdDiv.style.backgroundColor = "red";

            OR

            document.querySelector("div").style.backgroundColor = "red";

            (more examples in our class exercise folder)

            - Breaking this down:
                - We stored a reference to our div and then used
                the style property from our element to assign the background-color CSS property a value of
                "red"
                - Note: we used camel casing for the CSS property name -> whenever you have a dash in the
                name of a CSS property, you instead want to use camel casing when using DOM manipulation.
                - Note: This is adding inline CSS.

        - YOU CAN ALSO, use the .setAttribute() method

        const bodyElement = document.querySelector('body');

        bodyElement.setAttribute('style', 'background-color:pink');

        - Breaking this down:
                - We stored a reference to our body element, then used the
                the attribute method from our element (node) to assign the background-color CSS property a value of
                "pink" 
                - Note: This is adding inline CSS.
        

        NOTE: By default, a reference to the body element is already added to document as a property.
            - For exmaple you can do something like this: 
            
                document.body.style.backgroundColor = "white";
