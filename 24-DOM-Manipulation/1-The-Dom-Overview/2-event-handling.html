    You should be able to:
        Understand the concept of a "callback" (think higher-order functions).
        Explain the importance of callbacks in asynchronous programming.
        You're going to know the idea behind what asynchronous programming is.
        Write event handlers.
        Know what 'this' represents within an event listener.
        Use the event object to track events.

    HTML, CSS & JavaScript
        Again, if HTML is the bones of an animal, the CSS the skin, than JavaScript
        is the brain. 

        In order to create interactive and responsive sites, we need to use JavaScript to 
        update the DOM based on a user's actions.

        Examples of user actions are:
            - clicking
            - scrolling
            - typing
            - mouse movement
            - dragging content
            - dropping content
            - loading content
            - inputing text
        
        Examples of responses to user actions:
            If a user clicks on a sites nav menu icon, we want the menu to slide out revealing
            the ability to navigate. 
            
            When a users computer is finished loading an html page, we 
            want a "welcome to my site" message to slide into view.

            Maybe we want to give a user the option to click through a slideshow of images.

            Maybe we want to build a quiz on our page because we have educational content that we
            want our users to memorize.

    What is Asynchronicity?
        One of the special things about JavaScript compared to most other programming languages
        is that it is designed to run in the browser, and the browser supports user events!

        The browser has it's own runtime for JavaScript, which includes a space to hold things like
        event listeners. What this means is that there is code that we can write for our websites that
        doesn't have to adhere strictly to the top to bottom order of executing.

        For example: what if we want to wait for a user to click before we run a piece of code? We
        can do that by having code waiting around for that happen.

        That code that's waiting around and being executed on it's own time is code that is being 
        executed asynchronously. It's code that won't hold up our synchronous code from running (the
        code that's running one line at a time, from top to bottom). Remember, code that is written below
        other code in a synchronous execution, needs to wait for the code above to run before it itself runs.

    Event-driven programming
        A programming paradigm where the flow of the program is driven by events.
        To recap: this means that the program will wait or "listen" for events to occur, which is an example of
        asynchronous code.

    We can write what are called "event handlers" for the browser in JavaScript
        The syntax template looks like:

            element.addEventListener('nameOfEvent', functionToRun);
        
        An example:

            const ourH1 = document.querySelector("h1");

            ourH1.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
                e.target.backgroundColor = "red"
            })

        Breaking that down
            
            1. Element: This is a DOM node which we tying an event to.
            2. .addEventListener(): This is a method that can be used on an element Dom node to listen for a user generated
                event.
            3. 'click': The type of event we are listening for.
            4. (e) => { e.target.background color = "red"}: This is an anonymous function that will execute on the element
                the user is performing the action on.
