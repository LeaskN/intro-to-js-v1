// Number -> another primitive value
// Practice:
// Declare a variable and assign it to a numeric value
// Double that value and re-assign it to the previous variable
// Check it worked by logging to the console

// Create two numbers, assign them to variables and add them together
// Check it worked by logging to the console

// Create three numbers, assign them to variables and subtract them from the largest them together
// Check it worked by logging to the console

// Create two even numbers, assign them to variables and divide one from the other
// Save the new value to a unique variable, we'll use it on the next exercise
// Check it worked by logging to the console

// Create two odd numbers, assign them to variables and multiply one from the other
// Save the new value to a unique variable, we'll use it on the next exercise
// Check it worked by logging to the console

// Compare the previous two numbers
// Using greater than or equal to, or less than or equal to
// Log a true statement to the console

// Create a variable and log it's remainder, if divided by 3, to the console 
// What is modulo especially useful for?
