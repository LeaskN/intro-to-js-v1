    What are HTML attributes?
        - They are keywords used inside an opening tag to control the elements behavior / abilities.
        - Some HTML attributes are only available for certain tags.

<!--
    How do we add attributes to a tag?
        - An example using the anchor tag (a):
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp">Click Here</a>

        - The format is -> <openingTag attribute="value" attribute2="value2"> content </closingTag>
-->

<!--
    The href attribute
        - Can be used with <a>, <area>, <base> & <link> tags.
        - I've legitimately never used a <area> or <base> tag.
        - Lets just say we use the href attritube on either <a> or <link> tags.
        - The attribute "specifies the URL of the page the link goes to".

<!--
    The target attribute
        - By default, when you use href and link to a page, that new page will open up in the current
            window the user is in (after a user clicks on an <a> element).
        - You give the target attribute a different values to change where to open the linked page (document):
            -> _self -> Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked.
            -> _blank -> Opens the document in a new window or tab.
            -> _parent -> Opens the document in the parent frame.
            -> _top -> Opens the document in the full body of the window.

    List of common attributes seen out in the wild
        - class -> can be used on ANY tag - adds a class (used for multiple elements / styling)
        - id -> can be used on ANY tag - adds an id (unique / styling)
        - alt -> used with an img tag - try to always
        - style -> used to add inline CSS to an element.
        - rel -> used with the link tag - specifies the relationship betwen current document and linked.
        - src -> specifies the URL of the media file.
        - href -> species the URL of the page the link goes to.
            (
                More on the difference between src & href:
                    "src is to used to add that resource to the page, 
                    whereas href is used to link to a particular resource 
                    from that page. When you use in your webpage, the browser 
                    sees that its a style sheet and hence continues with the 
                    page rendering as the style sheet is downloaded in parellel"

            )
        - name -> specifies the name of the element - used on particular elements (google this).
        - data-* -> Used to store custom data / private to the page or app (I've used this a couple times)
