    What is flexbox?
        "The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module (a W3C Candidate Recommendation as of October 2017) 
        aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in 
        a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word “flex”)."

    Why flexbox?
        Shortly after HTML was created as a document-oriented language, CSS naturally followed 
        in order to add flair / style / more defined visual features for HTML. One of the ideas
        behind CSS was to not allow it to clutter the semantic value of HTML. CSS attempted goal
        was to normalize styling accross browsers - that didn't work out 100% unfortunately and
        still remains probably one of the more frustrating parts of web development.

        Flexbox came into existence to help with some of the shortcomings of CSS allowing for a easier
        and more versatile way of creating a website layout.

    Vertical alignment
        Hmmm... how do we align an element vertically & horizontally? (This is a very common problem).
