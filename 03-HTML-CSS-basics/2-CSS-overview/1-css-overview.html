    What is CSS?
        - It stands for Cascading Style Sheet.
        - A computer language - a design language.
        - Meant to help with the presentation of web pages...
        - ... It describes how HTML elements are to be displayed -> the styling.
        - Think back to that analogy of the make-up of an animal -> the skeletal structure is the
            HTML, the brain is JavaScript AND the skin is CSS.
        - "CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript"
        - CSS can save you a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages.
        - You generally want to store your CSS in an external stylesheet.

    What does CSS code look like? (pg. 231)
        - CSS uses rules that associate with HTML elements
        - What a CSS rule looks like 
        
            p {
                font-family: Arial;
            }

        - The breakdown:
            - p                  -> the selector.
            - font-family: Arial -> a declaration.
            - font-family        -> a property (like a property on an object in JavaScript... OH BOY!).
            - Arial              -> a value.
        

        - CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified
            elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

    External vs Internal CSS (pg. 235)
        - <link> -> this tag allows you to connect your HTML with your CSS
            - href -> Hyper Reference (it's a hyperlink) -> within the link tag this is actually how you link to your CSS.
            - type -> this is how you indicate what kind of document you are linking to - 'text/css'
            - rel -> 
        - <style> -> you can add an internal stylesheet to your HTML documents using this tag

        - Why use one or the other? (pg. 241)

    CSS Selectors (pg. 237)
        - There are A LOT of selectors to choose from
            ie. element selector - p <--- selecting just the <p> tags
                element element selector - div p <-- selecting just the p tags that are children of div tags
                element + element selector - div + p <-- selecting the first p tag that is a sibling of div tags
                
                id selector - selects ONLY the element with the corresponding id attribute
                class selector - selects ALL the elements with the corresponding class attribute

    How CSS rules cascade (pg. 239)
    - Last Rule -> 
        Be aware that if you have a rule with the same 
        level of specificity as another, the rule that is below it in your stylesheet will take
        precedence.

    - Specificity -> specificity in CSS determines which CSS selector takes precedence. 
        AKA, you can overwrite styles if you want... check out the starwars resource to see
        which selector trumps another. Also, be aware that if you have a rule with the same 
        level of specificity as another, the rule that is below it in your stylesheet will take
        precedence (Last Rule).
        
    - !important -> this will override any level of specificity -> same rule applies, however if 
        the CSS rule is below another !important selector (Last Rule).
