  HTTP Requests
    - HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource. Although they can also be nouns, these request methods are sometimes referred to as HTTP verbs.

    - GET Method
      - This is HTTP method that we'll be using for our Netflix project to literally get back information via the TDMB API.
      - Everytime I use my browser, enter in a url in the URL Bar, I'm making a GET request.
    
    - POST Method
      - Allows us to add information into a database, via an API.
