    The Holy Grail Layout
        Check the image in this folder! There is also a wikipedia page about it...
            - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_grail_(web_design)
        
        Using this layout will allow for seamless stacking of elements as the screen
        gets smaller. ITS RESPONSIVE!
