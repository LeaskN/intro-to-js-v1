<!-- 
    
    Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.
    There are two display values: block and inline.

    (W3Schools - https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp)
    Block Elements
        - A block-level element always starts on a new line.
        - A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

    Inline Elements
        - An inline element does not start on a new line.
        - An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

    ALSO NOTE: Each element (AKA Tag) has default styling - there area also default Block Elements & default
    Inline Elements
