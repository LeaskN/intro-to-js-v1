    What is Semantic HTML?
        - It's the correct usage of HTML tags to help reinforce the meaning of the content you
            are using them with.
        - ie. paragraph tags <p></p> should be used with paragraphs, <nav></nav> tags should be used with a 
            navigation.
        - It also helps screen readers, search engines, and other devices determine the significance and
            context of web content.

    What is the anchor tag? 
        - It looks like: <a> </a>.
        - These are used for hyperlinks. VERY big deal. These make up the the Web in the World Wide Web. This is how we can navigate 
        around the web, link to other pages etc.
    
    Anchor tag example:
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp">Click Here</a>
