/*Â Objects:
   Review - What do we remember about Objects?
    - They have key value pairs
    - They have properties -> this is another word for a key-value pair (or just the name of a key)
    - They store pieces of data
    - Instead of indices, we use keys to access information stored within an object
    - You can store an object in a variable
    - You can different types of data in an object - ie. a function (which is also an object)
    - Objects have methods! These are functions that are relate to the object
    - You can add, read, update & delete values from an object
    - "This" is a keyword generally associated / used with objects

/* 
    AUTOMOBILE EXAMPLE 
        Imagine you own a dealership and want to create a database of all the vehicles you have in stock. Instead of writing out
        an object the way we've learned before (ie. using an object literal) for each vehicle, we can create an Automobile class
        that will serve as a template for all Automobile objects.

        Note: We PascalCase (start with a capitalized letter) class names by convention. We don't do this with objects.
*/

/*
    Breaking it down: The Constructor
        When creating a class, the constructor method should stand out to you as a main difference between class and object syntax.
        This method is called every time you create a new instance of a class (where an object is created from the class). 
            - The below constructor accepts 4 arguments: brand, miles, sprice, speed.
            - We are using the "this" keyword within a class structure so that the context of our variables carries over to each individual
            instance we create.

    Getter and Setter functions
        These are known as "accessor functions". We use them to "set" and "get" our objects property values.

        What is the point of this?
        -> https://zellwk.com/blog/why-use-getter-and-setter-functions/

            There are two reasons:
                1. Syntax Reasons
                2. Encapsulation (oh boy) --> this is one of the PILLARS OF OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

    Inheritance / Creating child classes (aka subclasses)
        What if we wanted more specific classes for the Automobiles in our dealership? Well my friends, let me introduce
        you to this keyword called "extends", the concept of inheritance, and the concept of a child class.

        What is inheritance?
            It's simply when you want another class to inherit properties / methods from a "parent class".
            The concept of inheritance is ANOTHER PILLAR OF OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING.

        The "extends" keyword...
