    The CSS Box Model (pg. 229 - 230) - This defines:
        1 -> The flow of your document
        2 -> Block vs Inline elements

    What is the CSS Box Model?
        ALL HTML elements are boxes - webpages, at a base level, are made from boxes. 
        Even if you see a circle on a page - it's a circle within a box.

    When thinking about the makeup of an element - again, think of the CSS Box Model:
        (From: W3schools)
        An element will have (starting from the inside of the element and moving out):

            1 -> Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear.

            2 -> Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent.

            3 -> Border - A border that goes around the padding and content.

            4 -> Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent.

        (Note: these are all mallable properties on each element that we can control)

    What else?
        Aside from having Content, Padding, Border & Margin - all elements have a width & height property.


    Lets take a look at each part the box model:

        Margin -> The space around the element. More margin means more space between our element and the elements
            around it.

    ALSO NOTE: When Vertical Worlds Collide
        (From: https://css-tricks.com/what-you-should-know-about-collapsing-margins/)
        Collapsing margins happen when two vertical margins come in contact with one another. 
        If one margin is greater than the other, then that margin overrides the other, leaving one margin.
