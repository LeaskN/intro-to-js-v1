    READ CHAPTER 15!!!! All this info is beautifully explained & illustrated there.
    When you come across the float & clear property, just know this is what I want to avoid talking about
    because we have flexbox!

    Note: within chapter 15 you'll run into overflow - this is still a concern. 

    What is Positioning?
        - First of all, position is a property on an element.
        - You can adjust the value of that property to build up more complex layouts.
        - IE. creating a sticky header / navbar -> https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_navbar_sticky.asp

    What values can you use with the positioning property?
        - Static - this is the default value of every element.
        - Relative
        - Absolute
        - Fixed
        - Sticky
    
    Lets break these down:
        - Relative:
            p {
                position: relative;
            }

            Doing the above positions the element relative to it's normal position within the flow of the 
            document - nothing will change.

            p {
                position: relative;
                left: 50px;
                top: -20px;
            }

            Once we set an element to relative (or absolute, or fixed), we have access to the top, right, bottom & left properties of
            that element. We can then offset the element relative to it's normal position using those properties.
    
            Note: The only issue/thing to keep in mind when with using these offsets, is that the rest of the page 
            will treat the element as if it's still in it's original space.

        - Absolute:
            div {
                position: absolute;
            }

            Doing the above will position the element relative to it's nearest positioned ancestor element (so siblings don't count).
            A "positioned element" is any element that doesn't just have it's default set, which again is position: "static".
            If there isn't a positioned ancestor nearby, it'll default to using the <body>.

            Note: your absolute(ly) positioned element will be REMOVED FROM THE NORMAL FLOW OF THE PAGE (you can think of it as floating around).

            div {
                position: absolute;
                right: 100px;
                top: -30px;
            }

            We also have access to the top, right, bottom & left properties when we use position: absolute -> these values will offset
            our elment relative to that ancestor it's attached itself to.

        - Fixed:
            div {
                position: fixed;
            }

            When you do this to an element, you are positioning it relative to the viewport (the browser window). As a consequence, 
            it'll stay in the same place even if the page is scrolled. You also have access to the top, right, bottom & left properties
            that will affect the positioning accordingly.

        - Sticky:
            div {
                position: sticky;
                top: 0;
            }

            An element with a sticky position switches between relative and fixed - depending on the scroll position. Once it reaches
            that position (after you define it with top, right, bottom, left) the position will switch from relative to fixed.

            Note: Internet Explorer doesn't support this position - also, with Safari, you have to use a -webkit- prefix:
                div.sticky {
                    position: -webkit-sticky; /* Safari */
                    position: sticky;
                    top: 0;
                }

    What is the z-index of an element?
        - It's another property. This property specifies the stack order of an element (like a stack of plates).
        - An element that has a bigger z-index is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.

        Note: it'll only work on positioned elements, and flex items (elements that are direct children of 
        flex containers -> we'll get into flex box soon).
