Instructions for this assignment:
       Go into the images folder and find the file labeled
       "final-result.png". You want to try and replicate this image by
       adding css to the HTML structure I've provided. The idea is to not
       change the HTML - just style it. Make sure you add your own css
       to a new file and link it to the HTML. Don't add anything to the reset.css file.

       You should be trying to use grid and flexbox where ever you see fit.
       Make sure to use the link to your CSS file (from your github) as a submission to
       the homework.
